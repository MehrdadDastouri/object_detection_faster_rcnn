# Object Detection with Faster R-CNN in PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model from PyTorch's torchvision library to perform object detection on a given image. The Faster R-CNN model is one of the most popular architectures for object detection tasks and is trained on the COCO dataset.

## Features
- Loads a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model with ResNet50 as the backbone.
- Performs object detection on an input image.
- Visualizes detected objects with bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores.
